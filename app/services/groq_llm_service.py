"""Groq-compatible LLM service with consecutive user message merging.

Groq's streaming tool-calling is more sensitive than OpenAI's to consecutive
user messages in the context.  When the STT splits a single utterance across
multiple frames (e.g. "The thing is I want to build" + "an agent for my
company"), pipecat's context aggregator appends each as a separate user
message.  Sending those back-to-back to Groq occasionally triggers:

    "Failed to call a function. Please adjust your prompt."

This subclass overrides build_chat_completion_params to merge any consecutive
user messages into a single message before the request leaves the client.  The
merge is purely cosmetic — semantically identical to what the user said —
and only affects the outbound API payload, not the stored context.
